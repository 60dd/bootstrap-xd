That is not all. 
You can use **Colors and Character Styles of Bootstrap in Assets Panel**. By placing text and objects and applying them, you can create realistic mockup in a short time.

## Features

Do you care how you did it? I traced the screenshots just.

### 2. Effective use of Assets Panel.

Make the most of your asset panel. You can place basic components and change the Colors, or apply Character Styles to placed text.
